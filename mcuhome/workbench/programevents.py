"""An invocation's event stream: NDJSON on disk, read from the backend side.

Build-container contract §8. The program appends one JSON object per
line to the file the request document named — UTF-8, flushed after every
line, append-only, never truncated — and every object carries an
``event`` name and a monotonic ``seq`` starting at 1.

**Why a named file rather than NDJSON on stdout**, which is what
contract v1 said as first drafted: file descriptor 1 belongs to west,
cmake, ninja, gn and zap, so a program whose events share it corrupts
its own stream and never notices locally. A named file removes the
failure mode structurally, survives an out-of-memory kill readably, and
gives a reconnecting client a resume-from-offset.

**The file is the replay buffer, and there is no other one.** It stays
on disk for the life of the environment, so a consumer that reconnects
can answer "I last saw seq N" by reading it from N — no in-memory ring,
nothing to size, and nothing a reconnect can find already evicted.
Whether anybody reconnects is not this module's business: a local build
never does, and a build server serves exactly that out of the same file.

Two backend duties this module carries, both from §8:

* **Lines longer than 8192 bytes and non-objects are discarded and
  counted, never treated as an abort.** A program that writes rubbish
  into its own event stream has not failed its build, and a backend
  that stopped on one would turn a cosmetic defect into a lost
  invocation.
* **Unknown names are relayed opaquely.** A backend "passes an event
  whose name it does not know through to its client verbatim, with its
  fields intact, and never drops it, never rewrites it and never treats
  it as an error" — which is what lets a third-party program report its
  own phases under ``x-`` names through a backend that has never heard
  of them.

And one thing this module deliberately does not do: infer. "A backend
MUST NOT infer anything from a name it did not receive" — an absent
``build.memory.region`` may mean the program emits no events at all, or
that an incremental build relinked nothing. The result document is
where the question of what was produced is answered.

It lives with the orchestrator because it is the *driving* half of §8
and is the same duty wherever the driving happens: one implementation,
whether the events go to a terminal, to a dashboard in the same process
or through a build server's socket.
